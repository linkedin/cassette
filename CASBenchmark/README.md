README for CASBenchmark
=======================

This is a benchmark for Cassette written using Apple's [Swift Collections
Benchmark](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark).

To build and run, open Xcode and select the CASBenchmark scheme, then
Product -> Run.

This will build and run the benchmarks (which will take a few
minutes), then open an image file on the local system showing the
results of the benchmarks.
